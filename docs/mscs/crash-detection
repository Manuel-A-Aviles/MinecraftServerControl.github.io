## Using Backup

MSCS has the ability to automatically restart after a crash is detected. This feature can be set on a global basis or on a per-world basis. 

---

## Scheduling Backups

To schedule backups so they run periodically, please see [scheduling tasks](scheduling-tasks).

---

## Viewing & Restoring Backups

You can view the backups created by running the `mscs list-backups` command, and restore a backup using the
`mscs restore-backup` command.

You can specify how long to keep backups by changing the `mscs-backup-duration` property in `mscs.defaults` or the
world's `mscs.properties` config file (see [Adjusting World & Server Properties](adjusting-world-server-properties)).

### Restoring Backup Example

To list the date and time of all available backups for a world named `alpha`:

```bash
mscs list-backups alpha
```

To restore a specific backup for `alpha`:

```bash
mscs restore-backup alpha 2015-03-25T21:15:11-06:00
```
