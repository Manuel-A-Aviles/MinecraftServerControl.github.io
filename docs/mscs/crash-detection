## Enabling Automatic Crash Detection & Restarts

MSCS has the ability to automatically restart after a crash is detected. This feature can be set on a global basis or on a per-world basis. 


```bash
mscs list-backups alpha
```

To restore a specific backup for `alpha`:

```bash
mscs restore-backup alpha 2015-03-25T21:15:11-06:00
```
